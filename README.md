# SE-Calc node.js
Oman395 (Oran RH) needed to calculate blueprints for a ship he designed so he looked for a good blueprint calculator. The best he could find was this one, but he found it did not support some new blocks. So he did the only logical thing, creating a whole new calculator based on Node.JS, that can be packaged into an EXE file, and since it doesent have any blocks hard-coded and instead gets data from the game files, it should in theory add the new blocks in a SE update.

To use, drag the space engineers folder (right click SE on steam -> properties -> browse local files -> common) onto the window that opens, select the window, and hit enter. Next, drag the folder for the blueprint you want to calculate (%appdata& -> SpaceEngineers -> blueprints -> local), select the program, and hit enter. The program will get the blocks and their costs from the SE files, and get the blueprint and its requirements from the file, and combine them to get a material cost. It will be displayed on the window, and a .txt file will be saved with the costs. The window will auto close in 10 seconds, or when you close it.

If you want support in your own OS, download all files, as well as node.js. Add the NPM package 'pkg' (npm i pkg -g), then run pkg --targets "host" as outlined in the pkg docs. The program has only been tested in windows x64, so dont get mad if it doesent work.
