# SE-Calc
SE Calculator is a project I made so people could easily calculate the amount of components used in a specific blueprint from Space Engineers.  It wasn't a small project to get it working, so any donations are very welcome but not neccessary.

To have it calculate your blueprint, just open the folder with blueprints and pull the .sbc file to the icon of the Calculator. I suggest saving the calculator file directly to your blueprints folder. Keep in mind it won't work if you open the script itself.
